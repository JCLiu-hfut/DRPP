# DRPP

This project combines GPT and patterns to extract text information based on writing style.

How to use this codeï¼Ÿ
    The code is mainly divided into two parts.
    
  1. Use get_Coarsedensityannotation.py to complete the initial labeling of data using GPT.
     
    $ python get_Coarsedensityannotation.py
  2. Use the preliminary annotation of GPT to obtain pattern information and use this pattern to remove incorrect annotations. Than, the pattern library is generated by combining benefit=domain knowledge.Finally,Use the pattern library generated in the previous step to complete Information extraction.
